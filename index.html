			Welcome to the documentation page for gloom! Gloom is a 3D rendering header made for C++, primarily intended for use by beginners transitioning from other simpler rendering tools such as pygame. Gloom is incredibly limiting because of its simple nature. If you are looking to learn OpenGL, <b>DO NOT</b> use this header.
		</p>
		<p>
			Gloom was made using other headers which were not created by me. These include: glad (glad.h), GLFW (glfw3.h), GLM (glm.hpp), and assimp (Importer.hpp). I take no credit for the creation of these headers, and only used them in this project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reasons to <b>NOT</b> use gloom:<br>
				- You are experienced with OpenGL<br>
				- You want to create 2D games / tools<br>
				- You want your rendering tool to be very flexible and advanced<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Reasons to use gloom: <br>
				- You are inexperienced with OpenGL, and want to learn but you need a bridging gap<br>
				- You want to create 3D games / tools <br>
				- You want your rendering tool to be very simple and easy to use <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Gloom is a <b>RENDERING HEADER</b>, and not a game engine. It is, simply put, definitions for functions in glad, glfw, glm, assimp, and opengl headers.
